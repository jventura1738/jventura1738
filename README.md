## Quick fax about me:

### Personal

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a bot for 'copping' limited designer clothing drops. (with @jacobduncan00, he's the web dev master)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Matching Theory (Markets) and my WebPortfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me: j.ventura1738@gmail.com (academics) or @yovng_zoom (music) on IG.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning and teaching others what I learn!  Maybe I'll be a professor one day.
- 💡 Extra fun fact: The λ on my profile is simply an allusion to the somewhat-joke "Lambda Group" created in my Discrete Mathematics class with @jacobduncan00 and @Blaine-Mason.  [Project Lambda coming in the near future]
